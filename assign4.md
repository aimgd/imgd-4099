## Assignment 4

This simulation consists of 2d particles that have positions and velocities and are effected by forces, similar to N-bodies. They are being simulated on a compute shader, and force is applied by a field of scrolling value noise and curl noise. The curl noise is also created using value noise. The scrolling noise fields create a visually pleasing effect similar to a liquid simulation while not having to actually simulate forces between particles. The curl noise causes vorticies to appear in the flow of particles similar to how a real fluid would, and the vector noise field creates compression waves throughout the particles. The settings that the viewer can control are the frequencies and amplitudes of both noise fields, as well as some properties of the particle graphics. The particles are stretched by their velocities, which kinda looks like motion blur or warping, and contributes to the perception motion to the viewer. The colors of the particles are also controlled by velocity and their position on the screen. I had originally messed around with different integration methods (Verlet integration) but Euler integration was the simplest and as the goal isn't to have the most accurate integrator but just something that looks visually appealing, and the methods didn't make much of a difference.
