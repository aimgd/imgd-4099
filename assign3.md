## Assignment 3

This WebGPU program shows an implementation of the Gray-Scott reaction diffusion system. Implemented in compute shaders, it displays the field showing the amount of "A" substance remaining in the simulation at a given point in space. There is also a TweakPane menu that allows the user to control the simulation parameters for the reaction diffusion, as well as some settings that control visualization, like surface lighting. For visualization, the rendering code uses the gradient of the reaction diffusion field to obtain a surface normal, and show diffuse lighting for 2 lights from different angles. This allows there to be a pretty cool effect which follows the countour of the created shapes.

When it came to the lighting, I also explored looking at using the "B" substance field, but as it came very close to resembling the inverse of the "A" field it never really gave any interesting results. One thing I would look into in the future if reattempting this is possible the derivative of the "A" field visualized might produce an interesting effect, that while looking aesthetically nice, also shows the behaviour of the simulation even better. An interesting behaviour I noticed is that while the gradient doesn't change much until it reaches the areas where it is majority "B" substance, the normals are still effected quite a ways out into the "A" substance, showing that there is in fact a little bit of "B" substance making its way far into the "A", but not properly growing.
